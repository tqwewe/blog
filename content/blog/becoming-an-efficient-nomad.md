Having lived in Indonesia for 6 months, and Malaysia for 3 months, I would love to share my insight into
how to stay efficient with your work life.

### What are your requirements?

Depending on your work, you'll have specific requirements.

Most commonly, you'll have these few basic needs:

1. A decent wifi connection
2. Power point to charge
3. A peaceful work environment (with access to coffee)

While your Airbnb or hotel may fulfill all these needs, it can be quite difficult to get into a flow state.
And who wants to stay at home while you're traveling?

### Cafes

In Indonesia, I found a quiet cafe called [Say Something Coffee]. They provided free internet access, great coffee,
and delicious food.

I worked from the cafe nearly every day during my stay, and managed to create [Thalo], a Rust crate for event sourcing.

### Co-working office space

In Malaysia, I initially tried working from my Airbnb, but due to the lack of a nice desk, I browsed for a co-working
space, and there just so happened to be one in the residence where I was staying called [MyOffice][myoffice].

After reaching out I was given a tour, and it was amazing.
I was provided with my own desk, which included 2 power points and a personal drawer, all for 480 MYR/month.

While working at MyOffice, I created [Submillisecond] web framework along with [Submillisecond Live View].

### Conclusion

If you're traveling and finding it hard to stay motivated with your work, try browsing for nearby co-working spaces.
If you're on a tight budget, try finding a nearby cafe. You'll have the opportunity to meet new people
and avoid staying in your apartment every day.
