### From humble beginnings

Hi! As you've probably guessed, I'm Ari. A developer originating from Adelaide, Australia.

I got into coding when I was 12 years old. It started with going through the JavaScript course in codecademy. I was taught how to make the web page display an alert, and it blew my mind ðŸ¤¯.

From there, I self taught myself a lot about web develment, and was able to collect quite a few of my highschool friend Facebook logins and teacher school credentials via a phising pages. After playing with JavaScript & PHP for a couple of years, I took a Udemy course in Golang in 2016 and that's when my I had my first obsession with a programming language.

One of my most popular questions on Stackoverflow was from this period about reading a file with Go.

### Leaving highschool

In highshool, I took HTML classes thinking it would be somewhat enjoyable since it's something I'm good at.
Though, one day during class the teacher asked me if I also use HTML tables to place items side-by-side as that's what she does ðŸ¤¦.
I realised at that moment that highschool had nothing to offer when it came to my passion.

For this reason, along with the fact that I wasn't enjoying highschool in general and tended to skip classes often, I decided to leave highschool and pursue of a diploma at [TAFE] _(TAFE is like college in Australia)_.

### Starting my diploma

In the middle of 2016, I started studying a diploma of web development at [TAFE].
I was much happier finally since I felt like I was getting a headstart in life and studying the topic I'm so passionate about.

I excelled in my classes, got great marks and surprisingly quite enjoyed photography.

I studied at TAFE for a year, and decided to have a brief break from it. During this time I took an incredible short holiday to Bandung, Indonesia.

### An internship

Early in 2018, I was introduced to a designer and developer who were running a digital agency called [Sky Foundry].
I brought my 7 year old Lenovo laptop to their office, and briefly showed them some of the random projects I've worked on over the years.
With an email or two later, they onboarded me as an intern, and I was working full-time hours.

I started off doing some small edits and features to some existing client websites they had, and a couple of short months later they had offered me a permanent position with them. At this point I hadn't finished highschool and hadn't finished my diploma at TAFE, but decided the real world experience was much more valuable than study. In a way, I was still studying but being paid for it!

At the time of me becoming permanent, Sky Foundry got a huge client building a crypto-currency exchange platform.
I was brought onto the project along with another extremely talented senior developer.
Over the next 9 months, we built the frontend of a crypto-exchange in [VueJS]. A few developers joined and left the team during that time, but in the end, the senior developer, the two partners and me stayed throughout it all.

For the next year, I worked on many different clients, including shopify stores, custom wordpress themes, restaurant websites, crypto marketing pages, and much more.

### Working with [Energi]

After working with Sky Foundry, I joined Energi. The offer was incredible for me as a 20 year old developer. I was being paid 75% in Bitcoin, and 25% in Energi.

I worked with Energi for 8 months, during which time I helped develop the Energi Arcade Discord bot, along with some other projects. My skills were recognized quite fast, and I was performing code reviews in some of the projects within a month.

During my 8 months with Energi, Bitcoin was priced at around $3,000 - $8,000 USD. After Energi, Bitcoin slowly rose, peaking at $60,000 USD. This situation was incredible for me financially, as my earnings from 8 months of work had grown to 10x its value.

### Open-source & freelance

At the time of leaving Energi, I figured I worked full time with companies enough and decided my goal would be to build a product/business of my own rather than search for a new company to work with.

I built a couple of mildly successful Shopify apps during 2021 which, along with some ocassional freelance work, which both helped support me during this time. I also started working heavily with [Rust] ðŸ¦€.

During the second half of 2021, I was living in Indonesia for 6 months, and dived deep into [event sourcing] and developed a library called [Thalo].

The response I received from the community around Thalo was incredible, and it's become a project I'd like to evolve much further.

### Joining [Lunatic] ðŸŒš

My most latest endevour has been working with Lunatic, an Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly written in Rust.

The creator and team I've been working with are the most friendly I've worked with, and I've had the privilege of learning a whole lot about the project.
