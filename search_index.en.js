Why Build a Custom Event Store?\nEvent sourcing revolves around capturing changes to an application’s state as a sequence of immutable events. While it’s possible to use off-the-shelf databases like Postgres or traditional event stores for this, they aren’t naturally optimized for an append-only flow. That’s where Eventus comes in. By designing a store specifically for event sourcing, we can optimize for writes and simplify the process of retrieving events in sequence.\nThe core challenge with conventional databases is that they’re built for more general CRUD-like operations, where records are added, updated, or removed frequently. In event sourcing, data is never actually overwritten; events are recorded in the order they occur. This is inherently sequential, so a specialized database can take advantage of predictable I/O patterns to deliver more consistent performance, even when data volumes grow large.\nEventus at a Glance: Inspiration and Core Goals\nEventus was built from a desire to have a lean, high-performance event store that exploits the sequential and immutable nature of event sourcing. Many existing solutions rely on general-purpose databases or are tightly coupled to languages like C# or Java. Eventus takes a more minimalistic approach:\n\nIt stores and indexes events as they come in, without the overhead of features not needed in an event-sourcing model.\nIt aims for constant-time writes (O(1)) by appending data in segmented files.\nIt maintains simpler, more direct indexing for retrieving events by global ID or stream ID.\n\nBy focusing on event sourcing rather than broader use cases, Eventus avoids the complexity found in traditional relational databases or fully-fledged event store products that may include extra functionalities you don’t necessarily need.\nWhy Rust? Performance and Safety Benefits\nRust provides a set of features that make it uniquely suitable for building databases. First, it offers memory safety without a garbage collector, which helps avoid many concurrency pitfalls and performance penalties. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions let you write low-level, high-performance code while maintaining a clean, maintainable architecture. This is crucial when dealing with large-scale read and write operations, where even small inefficiencies can add up quickly.\nMoreover, Rust’s ecosystem includes libraries for serialization (like MessagePack), concurrency, and networking (for the optional gRPC layer), making it an excellent toolchain for building a modern database from the ground up.\nCore Architecture: Segmented Files, Global Index, and Stream Index\nEventus’s architecture is guided by a very straightforward principle: store events sequentially and track them with lightweight indexes. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nSegmented Files\n\nEach file, or “segment,” can contain up to 256,000 events. When one segment fills up, Eventus rolls over to a new segment. This segmentation keeps file sizes predictable and simplifies certain maintenance tasks (like re-indexing).\n\n\nGlobal Index \n\nAlongside each segment is a global index file. It contains pairs of (offset, position) for every event in that segment. This lets you quickly jump to the event data in the segment file without scanning through each record.\n\n\nStream Index\n\nEach segment also has a stream index, which uses a fixed-size hashmap on disk to associate stream IDs with a list of event IDs. This allows efficient retrieval of all events belonging to a given stream, again without needing a full scan.\n\n\nBy separating the data layer (the .events file) from the indexing layers, Eventus can be more resilient if an index becomes corrupted or needs to be rebuilt. The segmented approach also means writes remain constant-time, as each new event is appended at the end.\nData Format and Serialization Details\nEvery event is written in a compact binary format:\nBytesEncodingField\n0-7Little Endian u64Offset\n8-11Little Endian u32Payload Size\n12-15Little Endian u32CRC32C\n16-17Little Endian u16Record Type\n18-25Little Endian u64TransactionID\n26+BytesPayload\n\nInside the Payload section, Eventus uses MessagePack to serialize an Event struct that includes fields like event ID, stream ID, event name, and metadata. This structure keeps the core data needed for event sourcing small and quickly readable.\nReliability: Rehydration, CRC Checks, and Single-Writer Approach\nOne of the biggest concerns for any database is ensuring data integrity. In Eventus, CRC32C checks are used to verify the integrity of each event on disk. If a file becomes corrupted, the software can detect it as soon as it attempts to read the affected event.\nFirst-Class Transactions\nEventus treats transactions as first-class citizens, ensuring that every event or group of events is part of a transaction. Each event message is associated with a transaction_id (a u64), which uniquely identifies the transaction it belongs to. Here's how transactions are managed:\n\n\nTransaction Association: Every event is tagged with a transaction_id. This allows Eventus to group related events together, ensuring they are processed atomically.\n\n\nCommit Markers: After a transaction is committed, a special commit message with the same transaction_id but no payload is written to the event store. This commit marker signifies that all events associated with that transaction are finalized and should be considered valid.\n\n\nHandling Uncommitted Events: Any events that are read which are not committed (events not followed by a commit message with that transaction) will simply be ignored and considered uncommitted. In practice however, uncommited events would never typically be even written to in the first place.\n\n\nRehydration and Single-Writer Approach\nEventus uses rehydration at startup to rebuild its index files if they’re missing or out of date. This is possible because the underlying .events file is the single source of truth—its immutable sequence of events can always be scanned.\nAdditionally, Eventus adopts a single-writer approach for appending new events. This design simplifies concurrency control, removes the need for complex locking, and guarantees events remain in the correct order as they arrive.\nBy integrating transactions directly into the event handling process, Eventus ensures that the event store remains consistent and reliable, even in the face of failures or unexpected interruptions.\nPerformance: O(1) Writes and Scalable Reads\nBy writing events in an append-only fashion, Eventus ensures that each new event is appended to the tail of the current segment. The index files are updated accordingly right after the event is written. This mechanism allows writes to remain O(1)—they don’t slow down as data grows, because no large-scale rearranging or row locks are required.\nRead operations benefit from the streamlined indexes:\n\nThe global index points you directly to an event offset.\nThe stream index quickly returns all event IDs for any given stream.\n\nIn systems where reads can be further optimized with caching or partial in-memory indexes, this approach provides enough flexibility to scale while keeping the core logic simple.\nCurrent State and Real-World Use Cases\nAlthough Eventus hasn’t officially launched yet, it’s already powering a startup I’ve been building, serving as the backbone for a high-throughput event-sourced application. Because it focuses on essential event-store features—fast writes, sequential storage, and efficient indexing—Eventus fits nicely into any system where append-only data is key. Teams that prioritize Rust’s performance, or those seeking an alternative to C#/Java-based solutions, may find Eventus especially compelling.\nRoadmap: Horizontal Scaling, Monitoring, and More\nEventus is still growing, with exciting plans for the future:\n\n\nHorizontal Scalability\nDistributing writes across multiple nodes is a challenging undertaking, but it would open up new levels of throughput and fault tolerance.\n\n\nMonitoring and Queryability\nBuilding a foreign data wrapper or integration with tools like Supabase could make it easier to query events directly and monitor database health in real time.\n\n\nBackup and Archival Strategies\nAs more features are added, handling older segments through compression or off-site storage will become a priority.\n\n\nFor now, the focus remains on strong single-node performance and reliability.\nConclusion: Next Steps and Final Thoughts\nEventus was born out of a need for a specialized, Rust-powered event store that embraces immutability and sequential data. By focusing on the essentials—segmented storage, efficient indexing, and O(1) writes—Eventus offers a lean alternative to more bloated or general-purpose databases. Its Rust foundation delivers both performance and reliability, making it an attractive option for developers prioritizing these aspects.\nCurrently, Eventus is available on GitHub. While it’s a robust and stable solution, it comes with pretty much zero documentation. This is something I'd love to improve given free time, and I welcome any feedback or contributions from the community to help build out comprehensive guides and examples.\nWith future improvements like horizontal scaling on the horizon, there’s plenty of potential for expansion. If you’re building event-sourced systems and want a performance-oriented approach with a Rust backbone, Eventus might be worth keeping on your radar.

While Neovim has been a stalwart in the developer community for decades, Helix offers a fresh, modern approach that’s gaining traction. Let’s dive into a concise comparison to help you decide which editor aligns best with your workflow.\nBackground and Adoption\nAlthough I dabbled with Neovim in the past, it never became my primary editor despite me trying. Since early 2023, I've been using Helix exclusively, primarily for writing Rust code. The allure of terminal-based editors lies in their performance and minimalistic design, especially when contrasted with bloated GUI editors like VSCode. The multi-modal editing capabilities that both Helix and Neovim offer are a significant draw, providing a level of efficiency that many GUI counterparts lack.\nInstallation and Setup\nVim often comes pre-installed on Unix systems, making it easily accessible. For those opting for Neovim, a popular Vim fork, installation can be straightforward via package managers. However, Neovim's plethora of distributions can be overwhelming, requiring users to experiment to find the right fit.\nOn the other hand, Helix isn't typically pre-installed but can be effortlessly installed through most package managers or compiled from source using Cargo.\nSetting up Helix from source involves exporting the helix runtime, but overall, Helix’s configuration is minimalistic, requiring just a TOML file for customization.\nFor reference, my Helix config file I've settled on is 40 lines of toml. I have another guide specifically for optimizing your Helix configuration.\nUser Interface and Experience\nAt first glance, Helix and Neovim share similar interfaces. However, Neovim distributions often come heavily customized with plugins like Telescope for enhanced file navigation and search capabilities. Helix incorporates comparable features out-of-the-box, including a built-in file picker that rivals Telescope’s functionality.\nOne standout difference is Helix’s user-friendly key sequence popups, which display possible options as you begin typing a hotkey. For instance, pressing space reveals available actions like f for opening a file picker, making the editing experience more intuitive.\nIntuitiveness and Customization\nHelix has been notably more intuitive for me, primarily due to its cursor-based editing approach. Unlike Vim's verb-noun keybindings (e.g., dw for delete word), Helix follows a noun-verb pattern where you first select the text (e.g., w for word) and then perform the action (d to delete). This method feels more natural and user-friendly, especially for those new to multi-modal editing.\nCustomization in Vim is extensive, especially with Neovim, where the entire UI can be tailored using Lua scripts. In contrast, Helix offers limited customization options, focusing mainly on themes and behavioral tweaks like displaying open buffers as tabs. This simplicity ensures stability and a consistent user experience.\nFeatures and Functionality\nHelix shines with its built-in multi-cursor support, a feature that Neovim lacks without additional plugins. Multi-cursors significantly enhance productivity by allowing simultaneous edits across multiple lines or sections. Additionally, Helix's integrated key sequence popups aid in discovering and remembering keybindings.\nConversely, Neovim boasts a rich plugin ecosystem, offering endless possibilities for customization and extended functionality. While Helix doesn’t support plugins yet, its core features are robust and continually expanding.\nBoth editors handle syntax highlighting seamlessly using Tree-sitter, ensuring accurate and efficient code parsing while maintaining broad support for different languages. However, Neovim retains an edge with its native code folding capabilities, allowing developers to collapse and expand code blocks easily.\nPerformance and Efficiency\nIn terms of speed, both Neovim and Helix are exceptionally responsive and snappy. Vanilla Vim and Helix perform comparably, with minimal latency during editing. However, Neovim setups with numerous plugins can introduce slight delays, particularly during startup.\nResource consumption remains low for both editors, making them ideal for developers who prioritize efficiency without taxing system resources.\nLearning Curve and Community Support\nHelix is easier to learn for newcomers, thanks to its intuitive editing style and straightforward configuration. The verb-noun approach in keybindings enhances user-friendliness, allowing for a more visual-feedback based experience.\nNeovim, while powerful, comes with a steeper learning curve. Mastering its keybindings and extensive plugin configurations requires time and dedication. Fortunately, Neovim’s vast community offers a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support channels, including popular YouTube educators like @ThePrimeagen.\nHelix's community, though smaller, is growing steadily. The official documentation is comprehensive, and helpful content creators like @LukePighetti provide valuable tutorials and insights.\nPros and Cons\nHelix Pros:\n\nStability: Minimal configuration reduces potential issues, ensuring a reliable editing environment.\nBuilt-in Features: Multi-cursor support and intuitive keybindings enhance productivity without the need for plugins.\nPerformance: Lightweight and fast, offering a seamless editing experience out-of-the-box.\n\nHelix Cons:\n\nLimited Customization: Fewer customization options compared to Neovim, which might deter power users.\nNo Plugin Support: Currently lacks a plugin ecosystem, though this is in development.\n\nNeovim Pros:\n\nExtensive Plugin Ecosystem: Endless customization and functionality through plugins.\nLarge Community: Abundant resources, tutorials, and community support.\nProven Stability: Decades of development and use have made Vim a reliable tool.\n\nNeovim Cons:\n\nSteep Learning Curve: Complex keybindings and configurations can be daunting for beginners.\nPotential for Bloat: Extensive plugin use can lead to maintenance challenges and reduced performance.\n\nFuture Outlook and Recommendations\nBased on my experience, I’m committed to using Helix indefinitely. Its stability, minimal configuration, and built-in features perfectly align with my workflow, especially for Rust development. The upcoming plugin support in Helix is an exciting prospect that could bridge the gap between Helix’s simplicity and Neovim’s extensibility.\nFor beginners, I highly recommend starting with Helix. Its intuitive editing style offers a smoother transition from GUI-based editors, allowing new users to achieve productivity without the initial overwhelm. However, for those who enjoy deep customization and tinkering, Neovim remains a fantastic choice, offering unparalleled flexibility and a vibrant community.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile both Helix and Neovim are formidable text editors, your choice ultimately depends on your priorities. If you value simplicity, stability, and out-of-the-box functionality, Helix is a compelling option. Conversely, if you seek extensive customization and a vast ecosystem of plugins, Neovim remains a powerhouse worth mastering.\nEmbracing a terminal-based editor like Helix or Neovim can transform your coding experience, offering speed and efficiency that GUI editors often can't match. Whatever editor you choose, the fact you're exploring these editors is awesome, and I'm very happy terminal-based editors live on in the modern world.\n\nHelix Homepage\nHelix Github\nNeovim Homepage\nNeovim Github\n\n","id":"https://theari.dev/blog/helix-vs-neovim/","title":"Helix vs. Neovim: A Modern Showdown of Terminal Editors"},"https://theari.dev/blog/timescaledb-kubernetes/":{"body":"As with most of my devops experience, setting up TimeScaleDB on my Kubernetes cluster has been a painful process\nof trying different solutions and digging through Github issues until I succeed.\nInitially, I tried using TimeScaleDB outside Kubernetes using DigitalOcean's managed postgres database, which comes\nwith support for TSDB, with one caveat – the Apache license version of TSDB doesn't support data retention among other\nfeatures. The full list of lacking features can be found at https://docs.timescale.com/about/latest/timescaledb-editions/#feature-comparison.\nAs data retention was a requirement for my project and is only available on the community license,\nI decided to install TSDB in my existing Kubernetes cluster, and here's how I did it.\nYou Might Not Need the Community License\nIf your only reason for switching from the Apache License to the Community License is to utilize data retention in TimescaleDB, a simple cron job may suffice. Otherwise, you can skip this section.\nBy default, a TimescaleDB hypertable stores data in chunks of 7-day intervals. However, this can be configured when creating a hypertable by specifying the interval. For example:\nSELECT create_hypertable('odds', by_range('timestamp', INTERVAL '24 hours'));\n\nThis would create a hypertable with chunks of 24-hour intervals.\nUsing the pg_cron extension—which your hosting provider likely already offers—we can set up a simple cron job to manually drop chunks older than a given date.\nSELECT cron.schedule(\n  'odds-cleanup',\n  '0 0 * * *', -- every day at midnight\n  $$ SELECT drop_chunks(interval '24 hours', 'odds'); $$\n);\n\nFailures\nThe TSDB docs show a list of recommended Kubernetes operators on their docs including:\n\nStackGres\nPostgres Operator (Patroni)\nPGO\nCloudNativePG\n\nI tried all of these, having success with only one: CloudNativePG.\nStackGres and Postgres Operator both come with the apache license of TSDB. I did find a promising comment on a\nGithub issue for using the Community license of TSDB, however even after following the instructions, postgres still\ndidn't let me apply a retention policy to my hypertable, due to tsdb still using the apache license.\nCloudNativePG with TSDB (Community License)\nSetting up CloudNativePG with TimeScaleDB Community License was a lot less painful than the other options.\nInstalling CloudNativePG can be done with a one liner:\nkubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.23/releases/cnpg-1.23.2.yaml\n\nMake sure to use the latest release.\nNext, create a yaml file for your database cluster as timescaledb.yaml, using the timescaledb-postgis image:\napiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1\nkind: Cluster\nmetadata:\n  name: timescaledb\nspec:\n  instances: 1\n  imageName: ghcr.io/imusmanmalik/timescaledb-postgis:latest\n  bootstrap:\n    initdb:\n      postInitTemplateSQL:\n        - CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;\n        - CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;\n  postgresql:\n    shared_preload_libraries:\n      - timescaledb\n  storage:\n    size: 5Gi\n    # storageClass: do-block-storage # In my case, I need a custom storage class with DigitalOcean\n\nAnd finally apply this file to your cluster:\nkubectl apply -f ./timescaledb.yaml\n\nAnd that's it!\nConnecting to the Database\nYou can find the password for your database with:\nkubectl get secret timescaledb-app -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode\n\nAnd connecting to it can be done by first port forwarding your database locally:\nkubectl port-forward timescaledb-0 6432:5432\n\nReplace timescaledb-0 with the pod name of your cluster.\nFinally connect using psql:\npsql -U app -h localhost -p 6432 app\n\nBest of luck!\n","id":"https://theari.dev/blog/timescaledb-kubernetes/","title":"A Guide to Setting Up TimeScaleDB on Kubernetes"},"https://theari.dev/blog/tokio-actors/":{"body":"In this blog, we'll explore a concise approach at implementing the actor model in Rust,\nusing Tokio and a smart application of traits. The actor model revolutionizes concurrent programming by\nintroducing self-contained units that communicate via asynchronous messages, avoiding shared state's pitfalls.\nThis shift simplifies development, boosts scalability, and enhances system resilience.\nQuickstart Guide to Actors in Rust\nActors encapsulate computation and communication, functioning independently to process messages sequentially.\nThis design inherently simplifies concurrency, negating locks and traditional synchronization,\nleading to more predictable and robust systems.\nFor Rustaceans, combining Tokio with traits to craft actors not only capitalizes on Rust's type safety and\nconcurrency controls but also facilitates the development of high-performing, fault-tolerant applications.\nBuilding an Actor with Tokio\nCreating an actor in Rust involves two primary steps:\n1. Spawning a Tokio Task: Each actor lives in its tokio task, allowing concurrent execution across\navailable system threads.\n2. Handling Messages Through a Channel: Actors receive messages via a\nmpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel, processing each in turn.\nHere's a quick look at what setting up an actor might involve:\nstruct CounterActor {\n    count: i32,\n}\n\nimpl CounterActor {\n    fn start(self) -&gt; mpsc::Sender&lt;i32&gt; {\n        let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel();\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            while let Some(amount) = rx.recv().await {\n                self.count += amount;\n            }\n        });\n\n        tx\n    }\n}\n\nTo interact with this actor, you'd send messages using the mpsc::Sender returned by CounterActor::start.\nWondering about receiving replies? Enter the oneshot channel, perfect for single message exchanges.\nBy pairing each message with a new oneshot channel, actors can easily send responses back.\nasync fn send(tx: &amp;mpsc::Sender&lt;(i32, oneshot::Sender&lt;i32&gt;)&gt;, msg: i32) -&gt; Result&lt;i32, RecvError&gt; {\n    let (reply_tx, reply_rx) = oneshot::channel();\n    tx.send((msg, reply_tx)).await?;\n    reply_rx.await\n}\n\n// ... tokio::spawn ...\nwhile let Some((amount, reply)) = rx.recv().await {\n    self.count += amount;\n    reply.send(self.count);\n}\n\nThis setup not only facilitates efficient message passing but also ensures our actors can reply directly,\nmaking our systems more interactive and responsive.\nUpgrading to Handle Diverse Message Types\nInitially, our actor setup could only deal with i32 messages. While using an enum for different message\ntypes seems like an obvious solution, it introduces limitations, especially when involving oneshot\nchannels for responses. This method hampers the developer experience and restricts message reuse across actors.\nRust offers a more elegant solution through trait objects, enabling any type to serve as a message.\nThis approach enhances flexibility and reuse without compromising on type safety.\ntrait Message&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Reply;\n    fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: T) -&gt; Self::Reply;\n}\n\nImplementing this trait allows any struct to become a message:\nstruct Inc { amount: i32 }\n\nimpl Message&lt;Inc&gt; for CounterActor {\n    type Reply = i32;\n    fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: Inc) -&gt; Self::Reply {\n        self.count += msg.amount;\n        self.count\n    }\n}\n\nTransitioning to Box&lt;dyn Message&lt;Inc&gt;&gt; in our channel simplifies message handling but introduces\na challenge with Rust’s trait object restrictions regarding the Reply type. Rust wont let us use dyn Message&lt;A&gt;\nwithout specifying the Reply type in the trait with dyn Message&lt;A, Reply = ...&gt;. Additionally, the first generic\nstores the message type, when we need the actor type instead.\nWe circumvent this by introducing a DynMessage trait, converting replies into a Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;,\nsidestepping the issue:\npub(crate) trait DynMessage&lt;A&gt; {\n    fn handle_dyn(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;, state: &amp;mut A) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl&lt;A: Message&lt;T&gt;, T&gt; DynMessage&lt;A&gt; for M {\n    fn handle_dyn(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;, state: &amp;mut A) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; {\n        Box::new(state.handle(*self))\n    }\n}\n\nWith this setup, our actor can now process messages as Box&lt;dyn DynMessage&gt; and return replies as Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;,\nwhich we can downcast to the expected type:\nasync fn send&lt;A, M&gt;(\n    tx: &amp;mpsc::Sender&lt;(\n        Box&lt;dyn DynMessage&lt;A&gt;&gt;,\n        oneshot::Sender&lt;Box&lt;dyn Any&gt;&gt;\n    )&gt;,\n    msg: M\n) -&gt; Result&lt;M::Reply, RecvError&gt; {\n    let (reply_tx, reply_rx) = oneshot::channel();\n    tx.send((Box::new(msg), reply_tx)).await?;\n    let any_reply: Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; = reply_rx.await?;\n    Ok(*any_reply.downcast().unwrap()) \n}\n\n// ... tokio::spawn ...\nwhile let Some((msg, reply)) = rx.recv().await {\n    let value: Box&lt;dyn Any&gt; = msg.handle_dyn(&amp;mut self);\n    reply.send(value);\n}\n\nThis method enhances our actor model's versatility, allowing for a dynamic range of message types without\nsacrificing Rust's type safety and performance benefits.\nIntroducing Kameo: Elevating Actors in Rust\nBuilding upon the versatility and robustness of the actor model we've explored,\nKameo is our advanced Rust library designed to implement actors with an eye towards simplicity and efficiency.\nKameo encapsulates the principles discussed, extending them with a suite of polished features that cater\nto real-world application needs:\n\nAsync Support: Async code with async traits.\nLifecycle Hooks: Callbacks for managing the lifecycle of an actor.\nLinks Between Actors: Create links between actors, stopping one if another is killed.\nConcurrent Queries: Query the actor concurrently without waiting for other queries to process.\nPanic Safety: Actor panics are contained and managed, maintaining system stability.\n\nWhat sets Kameo apart is its commitment to Rust's type safety and performance, all while offering an API that\nfeels native to Rust developers.\nThere's no reliance on complex macros or obscure type gymnastics; just pure, idiomatic Rust.\nKameo's message definition and handling mirror the simplicity and power of the actor model discussed earlier.\nHere’s a sneak peek at how effortlessly you can define and interact with actors in Kameo:\n// Define the actor state\nstruct Counter {\n  count: i64,\n}\n\nimpl Actor for Counter {}\n\n// Define messages\nstruct Inc(u32);\n\nimpl Message&lt;Inc&gt; for Counter {\n    type Reply = i64;\n\n    async fn handle(&amp;mut self, msg: Inc) -&gt; Self::Reply {\n        self.count += msg.0 as i64;\n        Ok(self.count)\n    }\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), SendError&gt; {\n    let counter_ref = Counter { count: 0 }.start();\n\n    let count = counter_ref.send(Inc(10)).await?;\n    assert_eq!(count, 10);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nCheck kameo out on Github https://github.com/tqwewe/kameo, and drop a star if you've enjoyed this blog post!\nFeel free to reach out with any thoughts or feedback about this approach.\n","id":"https://theari.dev/blog/tokio-actors/","title":"Tokio Actors with Traits in Rust"},"https://theari.dev/blog/working-efficiently-as-a-digital-nomad/":{"body":"Having lived in Indonesia for 6 months, and Malaysia for 3 months, I would love to share my insight into\nhow to stay efficient with your work life.\nWhat are your requirements?\nDepending on your work, you'll have specific requirements.\nMost commonly, you'll have these few basic needs:\n\nA decent wifi connection\nPower point to charge\nA peaceful work environment (with access to coffee)\n\nWhile your Airbnb or hotel may fulfill all these needs, it can be quite difficult to get into a flow state.\nAnd who wants to stay at home while you're traveling?\nCafes\nIn Indonesia, I found a quiet cafe called Say Something Coffee.
